        <h1>August 15, 1947 </h1>
        <p>Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the
            nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the
            Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly,
            came into effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic,
            when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day)
            and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution
            of India. India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely
            non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Indian National Congress under the leadership
            of Mahatma Gandhi who adopted these values from one of the early movements[1] in India led by Ram
            Singh Kuka (quoted in one of the letters by Shaheed Bhagat Singh referring Guru Ram Singh as his Dada Guru).

            Independence coincided with the partition of India,[2] in which British India was divided into the Dominions
            of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the
            displacement
            of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India,
            Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each
            subsequent
            Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the
            nation.[3]
            The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the
            shehnai music
            of Ustad Bismillah Khan. Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies,
            parades and
            cultural events. It is a national holiday.[4][5][6]

        <p>European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the late 17th century. Through
            overwhelming military strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established
            themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government
            of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic
            society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in
            1885.[7][8]: 123  The period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford
            Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian
            activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of
            non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.[8]: 167 
            <br><br>
            During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the
            resulting elections.[8]: 195–197  The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in
            World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the
            All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation
            was tempered by the bloody partition of colonial India into India and Pakistan.[8]: 203

        <p>In 1946, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II,
            realised that it had neither the mandate at home, the international support nor the reliability of native
            forces for continuing to maintain control in an increasingly restless India.[8]: 203 [16][17][18] On 20
            February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that the British government would grant full
            self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest.[19]
            <br><br>
            The new viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, advanced the date for the transfer of power, believing the continuous
            contention between the Congress and the Muslim League might lead to a collapse of the interim
            government.[20] He chose the second anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, 15 August, as the date
            of power transfer.[20] The British government announced on 3 June 1947 that it had accepted the idea of
            partitioning British India into two states;[19] the successor governments would be given dominion status and
            would have an implicit right to secede from the British Commonwealth. The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 &
            11 Geo 6 c. 30) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom partitioned British India into the two new
            independent dominions of India and Pakistan (including what is now Bangladesh) with effect from 15 August
            1947, and granted complete legislative authority upon the respective constituent assemblies of the new
            countries.[21] The Act received royal assent on 18 July 1947.
        </p>

        <p>Millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders in the months surrounding
            independence.[22] In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed
            followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was
            mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 people on both sides of the new borders died in the
            violence.[23] While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta in an
            attempt to stem the carnage.[24] On 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, the new Dominion of
            Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first Governor General in Karachi.

            75 years of independence
            The Constituent Assembly of India met for its fifth session at 11 pm on 14 August in the Constitution Hall
            in New Delhi.[25] The session was chaired by the president Rajendra Prasad. In this session, Jawaharlal
            Nehru delivered the Tryst with Destiny speech proclaiming India's independence.

            Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not
            wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world
            sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history when we step
            out from the old to the new when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds
            utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment, we take the pledge of dedication to the service of
            India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.
            <br><br>
            — Tryst with Destiny speech, Jawaharlal Nehru, 15 August 1947[26]
            The members of the Assembly formally took the pledge of being in the service of the country. A group of
            women, representing the women of India, formally presented the national flag to the assembly.
            <br><br>
            The Dominion of India became an independent country as official ceremonies took place in New Delhi. Nehru
            assumed office as the first prime minister, and the viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, continued as its first
            governor general.[27]: 6  Gandhi's name was invoked by crowds celebrating the occasion; Gandhi himself
            however took no part in the official events. Instead, he marked the day with a 24-hour fast, during which he
            spoke to a crowd in Calcutta, encouraging peace between Hindus and Muslims.[27]: 10
